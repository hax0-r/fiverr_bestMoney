        by the respective loan providers at the time of your application. Submitting a matching request
        through our website does not constitute a formal loan application. You must submit a separate
        loan application with the respective lender to receive a loan offer. We do not guarantee approval
        for any loan, nor do we warrant that the loan terms presented on our site will match the actual
        terms offered by the lender. <br><br>
